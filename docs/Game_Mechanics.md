# Reactor structure
The reactor is composed of three parts: the **input area** to the left, the **output area** to the right and the area between them. In certain levels the input and output areas are sub-divided into α and β inputs and ψ and ω outputs, respectively.  
Below the reactor are various instructions that can be used by the player. They are described in detail in [Basic instructions](#basic-instructions). Simply click the required instruction and drag it to the desired location in the reactor.  
The player carries out various reactions with the use of **waldos**. There is a red and a blue one, so they can execute two different algorithms at the same time. The goal is to create paths for the waldos with the use of the available instructions so that the required chemical compound can be formed and output in the right area.  
The reactor most often contains also special objects, which are required for carrying out the reaction or executing the algorithm. These are bonder plates, sensors and fusion plates. They are described in detail in [Special objects](#special-objects).
