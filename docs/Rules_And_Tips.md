# General
* You can move the Start instruction wherever you want.
* You don't have to use both waldos - sometimes one is able to execute the algorithm.
* It is a good idea to place bonders on the input.
* The actual shape of the molecule to be output is not important.
* Each waldo cen move through a single grid cell from two directions, at the right angle.
# Production assignments
* The molecule output in a reactor will appear in the next reactor in the exact position on the grid in which it was output.
* Molecules need some cycles to reach the reactor after leaving the storage or the previous reactor.
